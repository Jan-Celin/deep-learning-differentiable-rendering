# Gradient-based neural network input optimization

This project investigates how differentiable rendering can be used to improve the performance of neural network models.

In particular, it focuses on optimizing 3D mesh properties (such as shape and color) by integrating differentiable rendering into the training loop. The goal is to enable end-to-end learning where both the neural network and the 3D representation are updated using gradient-based optimization.

The project is still in development and is being done as part of my final thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.
